# EEG-Processing-Tensorflow-PyTorch

This repository contains two works for processing EEG data using different neural network architectures and frameworks.


1. EEG Time Series on TensorFlow:

Focuses on processing EEG time series data using TensorFlow.

Includes data preparation, model creation, and evaluation.

Useful for time-series analysis and modeling with TensorFlow.

2. EEG CycleGAN with PyTorch

Implements a CycleGAN architecture for EEG data using PyTorch.

Includes data augmentation, model definition, and evaluation metrics.

Useful for transforming and denoising EEG signals with GANs.
